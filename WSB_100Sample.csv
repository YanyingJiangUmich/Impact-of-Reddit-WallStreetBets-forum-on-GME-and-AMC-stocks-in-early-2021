1345356,eyoy8wa,Comment,cy0rp4,73.0,0.0,"Counter argument - if China doesn't tamp down on independence-loving protestors, and allows the situation to ""simmer"" in Hong Kong, the threat of other such protestors popping up in mainland Chinese municipalities grow. The Communist Party has to send a signal to the protestors if they intend on maintaining control throughout Communist China. If they do nothing, they look weak and helpless, and protests grow. If they tamper down on protests now, sends a signal to other revolutionaries, but the world community will ostracize China.  


Fortunately for us, outside of investing, this is great for us and sucks for the Communists. And if anything -- this is the time for the State Department to say we stand in solidarity with the protestors and continue to arm Taiwan.",2019-08-31 21:03:17,2019-09-01 00:03:17,2019-09-01,00:03:17

1452950,eyp1ed2,Comment,cxm2sd,18.0,0.0,"Just learned a lot from my uncle. I was dropping off stuff for my aunt and I asked her if she does anything with stocks, she said no, her husband does all of that and she knows very little. So while my uncle is sitting on the couch waiting for a football game, I start asking about the stock market. (They are business owners, they own several locations of their business in our large city.) Like any normal person I asked him for tips. He proceeded to tell me that he started trading with a large sum of money and anything he knows probably wouldn‚Äôt apply to me, other than that I should thoroughly understand all the terms involved in trading. After 5 minutes of no progress in the conversation, I ask him how much he actually invests with ($1.2 Mil.) I was surprised, but not that much since they‚Äôre considerably wealthy. I asked how much he started with and it was $700k. I asked him how long it took him to grow that much (5 years). I went on to ask him what was his highest point (he is currently at his high) and what was his lowest point. His first two years he went from $700k to $130k and at some point he realized how to actually profit consistently. I asked him what he realized. This is when he grabs both sides of my face, looks me dead in the eyes and softly whispers ‚ÄúThe market is fake and üåà‚Äù",2019-08-31 21:40:43,2019-09-01 00:40:43,2019-09-01,00:40:43

249208,cy2q5r,$LULU - Predictive earnings through social listening and sentiment analysis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cy2q5r/lulu_predictive_earnings_through_social_listening/,38.0,52.0,"Here's my thoughts and please challenge my assumptions; provide critical feedback. In the following, I will be using LULU as reference for this DD strategy.

All related consumer products are not equal: e.g. women do not typically go buy leggins at Target, and then make instagram posts about it. However, designer brands, like LULU have obsessive fans who think showing off leggings from them is üî• 

There are brand and market analytics products already out there called ""social media listening"" (sometimes, social media monitoring). They track keywords, hashtags, comments, FB, IG, Twitter, etc. They're typically used by brands themselves to understand consumer engagement, trends, promotions, sentiment. Furthermore, industry competitive analysis is typically supported as well. e.g. comparing #nike to #lululemon

I want to see if there are strong correlations using all social activity in the previous quarters and see if they can predict earnings sentiment / forward guidance. As stated above, I don't think this would work for all consumer brands though.

The leading software out there seems to be: Netbase, Sprinklr, and Synthesio - all of these seem to cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. I'm thinking of building my own and either leveraging Google Cloud or Azure for sentiment analysis of people posts/tweets/etc.

1452825,eyparf2,Comment,cxm2sd,19.0,0.0,"So...the Hong Kong protests has escalated again this weekend. Trump does not seem interested in intervening, but Chinese media is hinting that ""outside forces"" are helping the protestors, and are heavily pumping out anti-democracy rhetoric.


Why is this relevant? Well, Hong Kong is a major finance center, and also China's lense into the outside world. There are literally thousands of US expats over there as well as 30% of China's GDP. It's how Chinese companies get access to the US and European markets as well.

Xi Jinping has 2 options to end this quickly...crush the protestors with military force, or capitulate and admit that protestors can threaten the Communist party's absolute control.

China's PLA (military) can absolutely crush the opposition e-z. That'll be Tiananmen Square level scandal though...actually probably more because of how much social media there is now. That will 100% guarantee cause a recession also. Hong Kong and it's autonomy would be absolutely crushed.
China won't be immune from the financial backlash...recession will be global and he won't have many tools to stimulate the economy, especially with trade war going on. 

If China backs off, that will threaten Xi's president for life status; and undermine the Communist party. The mainland will try propaganda damage control, but the taste of freedom will be infectious. They'll forever lose its grip of absolute control.",2019-08-31 23:40:06,2019-09-01 02:40:06,2019-09-01,02:40:06
